# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Workspace has two apps; only use root `package.json` and root `src/` app. Do not import from `bitrix-ui-vue/` (leave it as reference).

## Bitrix24 and Vue
- The project is a Bitrix24 application built with Vue.js.
- B24UI Vue components should be used where possible
- There are markdown *.md files in the ./.github folder that contains details of API's and components that can be used.
